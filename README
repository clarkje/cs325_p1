			RUNNING THE PROGRAM 
**************************************************************************
   On your command line, type the following line:

		python [algoname.py] [Coin info file name]

   Where [algoname.py] should be replaced with one of the above files
   listed under the 'INCLUDED FILES' header, and where [Coin info file name]
   should be replaced with the coin info file's name. 
   (Just the name! no '.txt'!)

   NOTE: Again, PLEASE do not append the coin info file name with '.txt'! 
   Our program does that for you!

   You will need to run this command for each algorithm, and then immediately
   view the results file.

   For example, if we used the Coin1.txt file, you would use the following 
   three commands: 

		python changedp.py Coin1
			*you should be reading the results file now!*
		python slowchange.py Coin1
			*you should be reading the results file now!*
		python changegreedy.py Coin1
			*you should be reading the results file now!*

************************************************************************** 
			INTERPRETING THE RESULTS 
**************************************************************************
   The results from [Coin info file name].txt will be found in the main 
   directory, in file labeled:
			[Coin info file name]change.txt

   As mentioned above, you will need to check this file after each command,
   as each command will overwrite the aforementioned file. 

   If you see results in the following format:
	Algorithm: Greedy
	[2,0,5]
	7

   That means: using the greedy algorithm to compute the results, there 
   were 2 coins of the first denomination, 0 coins of the second denomination, 
   and 5 coins of the final denomination, resulting in a total of 7 coins.
